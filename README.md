# Real-Time Emotion Detection

## Overview
This project implements a **real-time emotion recognition system** using a webcam feed. The system captures live video frames, detects human faces, and predicts the **dominant emotion** of the subject in real time.  

It leverages **OpenCV** for video capture and face handling, and the **DeepFace** framework for deep learning–based emotion analysis.

The system can detect the following emotions:

- Happy 😄
- Sad 😢
- Angry 😠
- Neutral 😐
- Surprise 😲
- Fear 😨
- Disgust 🤢
